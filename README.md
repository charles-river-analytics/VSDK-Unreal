# VSDK Unreal Edition

The road to developing XR content is full of obstacles. VSDK is made by XR developers for XR developers to remove some of those obstacles so you can focus on building real interactive experiences.

Originally built for the Unity 3D engine, VSDK Unreal brings the same time-saving features to the Unreal Engine.

While VSDK Unreal should be compatible with previous versions of Unreal Engine, use with Unreal Engine 4.26 for best results.

**We are currently launching the VSDK Unreal Edition project. Documentation is coming to the GitHub wiki soon. In the meantime, please be patient as we finalize setup.**

## Disclaimer

VSDK Unreal is currently in **alpha** which means it is functional but not necessarily stable. Code is likely to evolve as we move towards a **beta** release, at which point the code is expected to be stable but not 100% bug-free.

### Features

VSDK Unreal was built using our real experience developing XR applications in both Unity and Unreal. We've worked hard building in key time-saving features that make it easier to go from prototype to full application.

- **Multiplatform Support**
    - Develop your experience once in Unreal Engine and easily deploy to common XR devices without significant rework
    - Support for less common I/O devices (i.e. hand tracking, eye tracking, and haptics) is a priority for our team, as we believe these are the technologies future XR platforms will be built on
- **Blueprint Ready**
    - Blueprint Scripting is one of the coolest features of Unreal Engine
    - Most of our code is written in C++ but is completely usable and extensible via Blueprint
- **Thorough Interaction System**
    - We've built an interaction system that covers the most common XR use cases, with an eye on immersive simulations
    - Locomotion, Object Interaction, and More!
